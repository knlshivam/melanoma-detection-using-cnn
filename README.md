## General Information
- Melanoma is type of skin cancer which if not diagnosed early can be fatal.
- So, developing a CNN model which can predict if the skin image is of cnacer or not and alert in advance
- this model can thus help dermatologists to predict the presence of cancer for early diagnosis
- Dataset consists of 2537 images  of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We created a multilayer cnn model, to predict the presence of the cancer
- Model shows the accuracy of 76% in prediction of the cancer
